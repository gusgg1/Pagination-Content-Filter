# Pagination & Content Filter

* This project has been written without jQuery.
* Included a search component so that a user can search for a particular student or students.
* When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search.
* If no matches are found by the search, there is a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
