# Pagination & Content Filter

#### Project 2

###### This is my second of twelve projects for the Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

* This quote-generator has been written in pure Vanilla JavaScript, without the help of jQuery, plugins or any framework.
* A long list of students is filtered in groups of 10 and pagination is added.
* Used unobtrusive JavaScript to append HTML for a search bar and pagination links.
* Each pagination link displays the corresponding list of 10 students.
* Included a search component so that a user can search for a particular student or students based on name or e-mail address.
* When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search.
* If the search results in less than 10 students then the pagination links won't be displayed.
* If more than 10 students the pagination links are added accordingly.
* If no matches are found by the search, there is a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
* When a search has been initiated a refresh button (X) appears at the right corner of the student container.
