# Pagination & Content Filter

#### Project 2

###### This is my second of twelve projects for the Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

* This project has been written *without* jQuery.
* A long list of students is filtered in groups of 10 and pagination is added.
* Each pagination link displays the corresponding list of 10 students.
* Included a search component so that a user can search for a particular student or students based on name or e-mail address.
* When the "Search" button is clicked, the list of students is filtered to match the search.
* If the search results in less than 10 students then the pagination won't display.
* If more than 10 students the pagination links are added accordingly.
* If no matches are found by the search, there is a message in the HTML to tell the user there are no matches.
